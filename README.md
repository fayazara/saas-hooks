# Saas Hooks

A TypeScript library offering unified utilities for common SaaS features, streamlining the integration and management of multiple third-party services.

## Inspired by

- The [Unjs](https://unjs.io/) ecosystem
- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) utils
- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library

## Overview

**Saas Hooks** aims to simplify the integration of various third-party SaaS services by providing a set of unified hooks. These hooks abstract away the complexities of different APIs, offering a consistent interface for developers. This library is particularly useful for applications needing to interact with multiple providers for services like payments, emails, storage, notifications, and more.

## What made me build this?

I am building a more robust version of my Nuxt 3 fullstack boilerplate [supersaas](https://supersaas.dev), where I needed a way to provide multiple payment/email providers, so I made some really robust composables for these. This made me realise this concept can be extended to so many **"services which provide the same solution"**

## Philosophy

1. \***\*Universal Compatibility\*\***: It should work everywhere - Browser, Node runtime, Deno runtime, Cloudflare workers (which I personally love using).
2. \***\*Framework Agnostic\*\***: Doesnâ€™t matter if its Next, Nuxt, Angular, React, if its a javascript project, it should work.
3. \***\*Ease of Use\*\***: The whole point of this is to make it easy to work with these unnecessarily complex interfaces.
4. \***\*Extensibility\*\***: The library should be easily extendable to support new services and use cases without major changes to its core.
5. \***\*Security\*\***: Follow best practices for security, especially when dealing with sensitive operations like payments and storage.
6. \***\*Modularity\*\***: Components should be modular, allowing developers to include only the parts of the library they need.
7. \***\*Type Safety\*\***: Leverage TypeScript to provide strong type definitions, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.
8. \***\*Minimal Dependencies\*\***: Keep external dependencies to a minimum to reduce potential conflicts and maintain lightweight library size.
9. \***\*Community-Driven\*\***: Encourage community contributions and feedback to evolve the library based on real-world usage and requirements.

## What will it solve?

- **Consistency**: Provides a uniform interface for different services, reducing the learning curve.
- **Flexibility**: Easily switch between providers without changing your application logic.
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes the integration logic, making it easier to manage and update.
- **Scalability**: Supports a wide range of providers, allowing your application to scale seamlessly.

## Features

### Payment

`usePayment()` provides a unified interface to work with multiple payment providers.

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
usePayment("stripe").createCheckoutLink(options);
usePayment("paddle").createCheckoutLink(options);

```

### Emails

`useEmail()` offers a unified service for sending emails.

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
useEmail("resend").send(options);
useEmail("aws-ses").send(options);
useEmail("sendgrid").send(options);
useEmail("plunk").send(options);
```
